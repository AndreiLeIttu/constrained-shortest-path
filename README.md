# Repository containing work related to Constrained Shortest Path research, as part of the Honours Programme 

## Current roadmap:

- [x] Coded basic version of shortest non-simple path between two nodes of a given graph. (no constraints)
- [x] Coded version mentioned in the general workflow - mandatory vertex constraints added to the shortest non-simple path.
- [x] Implemented model for simple paths using the bounded_dpath predicate.
- [X] Implemented a random test generator for the simple path model. 
- [X] Automated testing to quantify speed and efficiency of different models, using a Bash script.
- [X] Measure speed across a number of tests and output results to a different file.
- [X] Complete report stating results of the automated testing - [Link to report](https://github.com/AndreiLeIttu/constrained-shortest-path/blob/master/latex/automation/Automated%20testing%20analysis.pdf)
- [X] Continued testing but focused on the differences between the Chuffed and Gecode solvers by running both solvers on the same inputs and the same model and storing the results.
- [] Report about the differences between the two solvers in the case of the mandatory vertices constraint -
