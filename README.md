# Repository containing work related to Constrained Shortest Path research, as part of the Honours Programme 

## Current roadmap:

- [x] Coded basic version of shortest non-simple path between two nodes of a given graph. (no constraints)
- [x] Coded version mentioned in the general workflow - mandatory vertex constraints added to the shortest non-simple path.
- [x] Implemented model for simple paths using the bounded_dpath predicate.
- [ ] Implemented a random test generator for the simple path model. 
- [ ] Automated testing to quantify speed and efficiency of different solvers.
